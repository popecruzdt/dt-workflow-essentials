## Trigger Workflow Execution

Open the Workflow Essentials - Ingest and Alert workflow from the previous exercise.  Run the workflow and validate the results.  A new problem event should have been created.

Shortly after running the other workflow, the Workflow Essentials - Slack Integration workflow should have triggered as a result of the problem event.  Check the execution and validate the results.  Open the Slack channel and validate that the message contains the problem summary.
